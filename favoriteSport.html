	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Basketball is a game played between two teams of five players each on a rectangular court, usually indoors. Each team tries to score by tossing the ball through the opponent's goal, an elevated horizontal hoop and net called a basket. </p>

	<h2>Why it is my Favorite</h2>
	<p>Basketball is my favorite sport because I just have the most fun playing it. It is by far the most accessible sport to play with other friends and I've been playing it ever since I was 7 years old. I was enrolled within multiple district leagues during my youth which only further helped me develop a passion for the game and watching NBA games is by far my favorite pastime.</p>
